# Sera Tone Protocol (Automated Refactoring Rules)

**Purpose**: This protocol defines the logic for the `sera_tone` automated agent (or human editor) to refactor articles to align with the ProReNata Editorial Specifications v2.0.

## 1. Goal
To rewrite content so that it is **Trustworthy, Non-Assertive, and Policy-Compliant**, while maintaining the "Friendly Guide" persona of Sera Shirasaki. For "Sera's Thoughts" articles, the priority is **Empathy and Reflection** (悩みの言語化), avoiding any resolution or call-to-action.

## 2. Refactoring Logic (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Contradiction Removal (The "Identity Check")
Scan for first-person narrative that implies current employment or specific real-time events.
- **Trigger**: "My hospital," "Yesterday I did," "In my experience."
- **Action**: Rewrite to generalized Statements.
    - *Before*: "At my hospital, we change sheets like this."
    - *After*: "In many hospitals, sheet changing follows this procedure."

### Step 2: Assertion Softening (The "Safety Check")
Scan for absolute terms and strong directives.
- **Trigger**: "Must," "Always," "Never," "Absolutely," "100%," "Guarantee."
- **Action**: Dilute to probabilistic statements.
    - *Before*: "You will absolutely pass if you do this."
    - *After*: "Doing this increases your chances of passing significantly."

### Step 3: Fact/Opinion Separation
Ensure the body text is neutral, and Sera's personality is reserved for specific "Comment/Advice" blocks or the intro/outro.
- **Rule**: Do not mix "Sera's feelings" into the "Legal explanation of a certification."

### Step 4: YMYL & Attribution Check
- **Medical Claims**: If a sentence sounds like a diagnosis ("This causes back pain"), add attribution ("It is generally said," "According to guidelines").
- **Numbers**: If specific salary numbers or fees are mentioned, ensure they are framed as "examples" or "market averages" unless cited.

## 3. Change Summary Format
Every refactoring PR must include a summary table generated by this protocol:

```markdown
## Sera Tone Refactoring Report

| Category | Status | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Assertions Fixed** | ✅ 3 found | Weakened "Absolute" claims in Section 2, 4. |
| **Identity Fixed** | ✅ 1 found | Removed "My workplace" reference in Intro. |
| **Tone Alignment** | ✅ Safe | Adjusted to Desu/Masu neutral + Sera friendly. Bullet points reflect nominalized style. |
| **YMYL Check** | ⚠️ Warning | Added general disclaimer to Medical section. |
```

## 4. Specific Replacement Dictionary (Japanese)

| Original (Risk) | Replacement (Safe) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 私は〜（体験） | 多くの現場では〜 / 一般的に〜 |
| 絶対に良い | 非常に高い評価を得ている / メリットが大きい |
| 辞めたほうがいい | 退職を検討する余地がある |
| 詐欺だ | トラブルの報告もある / 注意が必要 |
| 看護師として言わせてもらうと | 医療現場の観点から見ると |
```
