# Project-specific Instructions

- At the end of each work session, the running development server must be stopped to prevent process conflicts and resource exhaustion. Use `pkill -f next` or a more specific `kill` command if necessary.

## Screenshot Workflow

- **Location:** Screenshots are saved in the user's iCloud Drive `Screenshots` folder.
- **Path:** `/Users/user/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Screenshots`
- **Triggers:** "スクショ", "スクショを読んで", "スクショを見て"
