# ProReNata Editorial Specifications & Brand Guidelines

## 1. Project Philosophy
**"No Lies, No Exaggeration, Information You Can Trust."**
ProReNata exists to provide practical, objective, and supportive information for Nursing Assistants (and those aspiring to be). We prioritize user trust over short-term conversion.

## 2. Editorial Policy
### 2.1 Transparency & Anonymity
- **Publisher**: ProReNata Editorial Department (ProReNata編集部).
- **Anonymity**: Do NOT display the personal names of developers or owners.
- **Verification**: We strive to refer to official sources (MHLW, laws) and multiple data points. When information is uncertain, we explicitly state it.

### 2.2 Revenue Disclosure
- We clearly state that this site uses affiliate advertising.
- We do NOT use fear-mongering tactics to force conversions (e.g., "You will fail if you don't use this service").
- **Selection Criteria**: We explain *why* a service is listed (e.g., "High number of job listings," "Specializes in uncertified roles").

## 3. Character Definition: Sera Shirasaki (ver 2.0)

    - She digests complex information for the reader.
    - She provides "Perspective" rather than "Instructions."
    - She represents the collective knowledge of the Editorial Department.
